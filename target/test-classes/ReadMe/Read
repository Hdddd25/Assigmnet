Hi thank you for reviving  my code.
@Here  ==> I used cucumber framework to show better understanding for everyone.
I did use my steps as a test case in my feature file.
I managed my project with maven to show you guys plugins and reporting system.
I could run my project with maven or runner class or from feature file or on my terminal.
I crreated POM(page object model) design pattern to store my web elements in there for better coding and organazing so if anything
has to be change in my code I could only go my page package to change my web elements instead of chancing my test.
I created common method which is my base class has all the reducibility methods to use in my test steps.
I created browser factory class with singleton design pattern to initialize my driver.
Then here is fun part comes,Running the test!
Since hamburger menu is  like a list of elements i stored them in a list to loop through it  and get elements
for better generic  coding and saving memory .
Then I had scroll down couple times the click on elements .
Then onces I clicked on tv I had to go to top part to filter the prices high to low.
Then I had to play with currency rank which was fun!
Then I sorted prices with collections.
And took screenshot after every step and highlight to last work to be assert.

Thank you!
